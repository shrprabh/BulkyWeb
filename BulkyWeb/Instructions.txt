# Command to Create a Database

To create a database and apply migrations:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

The above command will create a database, and inside, a table named `dbo._EFMigrationHistory` will be created.

## Notes on Database

Usually, any variable in the models table which ends with Id is considered as the primary key by default.or else we need to specify by using data annotations [Key] For example:

```csharp
public int CategoryId { get; set; }
```

Here, `21Id` is used to define the primary key.

Any operation related to the database should be implemented inside the application db context file.

# Adding Categories to Database

After adding categories, execute the following commands to add tables to the database:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddCategoryToDB
dotnet ef database update
```
```
